    old "Morris is... Morris is... pretty ok, I guess? Sure he might wipe me out on the spot if he ever finds out what I really am, but he's been nothing but helpful since we teamed up. I'm not sure how long he has had that bandaged hand though, I think he should get it checked, it kind of smells. Still, I'm glad he helped out with King and his parents. I wouldn't have been able to even think about that part of his life on my own. Guess you can't just get transported into another dimension and expect nothing to change at home. Note to self though; watch out for Morris' real power level, the guy's stronger than he looks."
