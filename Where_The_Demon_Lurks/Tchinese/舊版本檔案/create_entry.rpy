    old "Vendrake's like that grumpy uncle in the family that nags to everyone about how things were better back in the old days. Paw said that great-great-grandpa created Vendrake when the Underworld was first established. He's the first and oldest demon, not to mention the stuffiest. Every day it's '[name] file this report.' and '[name] put that tablet down and eat your dinner!' It's even worse when he barks at me about needing to give a lengthy speech for the opening of every new torture building. So infuriating."
    new "Vendrake就像每個家庭總會出現一兩個那種成天貴古賤今的的老大叔。爸說曾曾祖父在冥界形成時創造了Vendrake。他是最初也是最老的惡魔，還是最古板的。每天都「[name]，寫好這份報告。」來、「[name]，把那塊板子放下好好吃飯！」去的。最糟的就是每次在有新折磨設施開張時，他都會吼著要我發表又臭又長的致詞。煩死了。"

    old "There's a word for those of us who live and work in the Underworld, demons. It took great-great grandpa thousands of years of PR to get the people from earth to have the word stick in their own mortal lexicon. I heard they ran nightmare ads among famous philosophers and poets back then. I've seen some of those old ads. It's usually a demon in a bowtie going, “Sinners beware, stay off the path of righteous living, and you'll win a free trip to the Underworld with your personal torture demon to torment you for the unfathomable eternity of non-existence itself!” which was then followed up with a free tour that may or may not mentally scar the fragile mortal."
    new "有個詞被用來描述我們這些在冥界生活工作的存在——惡魔。曾曾祖父靠著上千年的人脈，才讓這個專有名詞流傳在地表上的人界裡。我聽說他們以前會播惡夢廣告給著名的哲學家或詩人。我看過一些。通常會有個打著領帶的惡魔告訴他們：「聽好了罪人們，只要你走在邪門歪道上，就能免費獲取通往冥界的旅遊資格，包辦你個人的折磨惡魔，給予你永劫不復的苦痛！」然後附贈一趟免費但可能會讓脆弱的凡人留下心理創傷的體驗之旅。"

    old "Amare is the self proclaimed genius of the Underworld. Paw's dad created him which makes him the third general created. The dude's mad about tech and machinery. He wants to know how things work and how he can apply that towards upgrading his own inventions. Although, he can go overboard sometimes and when he does go off the deep end, he commits to it. Once, I asked him to recreate this console I saw on earth but he made it into a flying drone that blasted lasers every time I pressed a button... I just wanted to play Wowzer's Odyssey."
    new "Amare自詡為冥界的天才. 他是老爸的爸爸創造的，也就是第三個將軍。這人超沉迷科技跟機械的。他想知道事物的運作方式，然後再運用在他自己的發明上。不過，有時候他是有點超過，而且還會越陷越深。曾經有一次，我請他幫我仿造一個我在地面上看過的遊戲機，但他做出來的卻是每次我按下按鈕都會發射出雷射激光的無人機……我就只是想玩Wowzer's Odyssey而已啊。"

    old "Fortis and I are close, like, he's a demon I can have a drink with anytime. Great grandpa created him and his brothers to help guard the Underworld from any soul dumb enough to attempt escaping. Despite his single head, he's actually a cerberus demon. Anyone who dares to point that out would be punched into next week. His greatest passions are working out, getting others to workout, and his brothers. Heck, sometimes I've been so unlucky to have been roped along into his cruel training regiment. Ugh, it's already exercise just from evading him during his workout highs."
    new "Fortis跟我很親近，是我隨時都能一起喝一杯的惡魔。曾祖父創造了他跟他的手足們來防止任何愚蠢的靈魂逃離冥界。雖然只有一顆頭，但他是隻克爾柏洛斯。夠種在他面前提到這個的，會被他揍得生活不能自理一星期。他最熱衷的就是健身、讓別人也健身、還有他的兄弟們。唉，有時候我也會不幸被拉去陪他做那些殘酷的鍛鍊。嗚噁，光是要在他健身的興頭上時躲著他，本身就是一種體能訓練了。"

    old "Nox, another name for the night. He was the last general to be created; Paw made him. Yet, I never saw them close with each other. Even with me, he keeps a distance and never reveals much about himself. All I know is that he's always looking out for opportunities to relax. His mysteriousness is matched by his skills with fighting style games. I just can't beat the guy in any 2P matches."
    new "Nox，夜晚的別稱。他是最後被造出來的將軍；老爸創造的。然而，我卻從沒看過他倆有多親近。對我也一樣，他總是保持一定距離感，也鮮少談及自己。我只知道他總想找機會放鬆。他的神秘度就跟他格鬥遊戲的技術一樣強。我從來就沒在玩家互打中贏過他。"

    old "The Underworld is the inverse of Up Above. I don't know how deep into the abyss this place goes but I tried dropping a coin out the window a few decades back when I was a kid and I haven't heard it land since. Each floor isn't the same, some are as small as a broom closet, some are huge enough to be able to accommodate entire cities within it, and some are literal office spaces. Though, most are office spaces. Paw taught me that the Underworld would expand according to the needs of the current ruling Demon Lord, but every time I try to have my own arcade room or my own private movie theater, Vendrake will inevitably show up and turn it into another freaking file room!"
    new "冥界是天堂的相反存在。我是不知道這裡到底有多深，但我幾十年前還小的時候曾把一枚硬幣拋出窗外，至今都沒聽見它掉到地上的聲音。這裡每層不盡相同，有些就跟清潔用品間一樣小，有些則大到能裝下整座城市，還有的就完全是辦公用區。應該說，大部分都是辦公用區。老爸有跟我說過，冥界會依現任魔王的需求而擴展。但每當我心想要自己的遊戲廳或個人影院的時候，Vendrake都會跑來把它搞成新的一間文件室！"

    old "How a demon looks is very important, it's not just part of their style but also their brand. Although demons have a fixed form that is purely an aesthetic choice, like enemies in a video game, demons have been known to shapeshift to suit the job they have. Sadly, my transformation skills are limited compared to other demons. I've proposed having every demon look like the characters from my favourite anime, but it's hard to make demons with multi coloured hair dressed in school girl outfits intimidating for torture."
    new "惡魔的外表是至關重要的；這不光是種風格，更是一種品牌形象。惡魔們雖然都有各自的固定型態，但跟電玩中的敵人一樣，也有眾所皆知的擬態能力能讓他們契合不同的工作。悲哀的是，我的變形技術跟其他惡魔差多了。我是企劃過讓所有惡魔擬態成我最喜歡的動畫中的角色們，但頭髮五顏六色、穿著女學生服的惡魔要拷問人類的話，威慑性太糟了。"

    old "Of all the jobs in the Underworld, being Demon Lord is the most boring of all. Ever since Paw revolutionized the system there’s nothing to do but file paperwork, go to meetings, approve new torture techniques, go to meetings, announce that we have new office printers, go to more meetings, review every single demon’s work performance, go to more fucking meetings about the next meeting. AHHHHHHHHHHH! WHY ARE THERE SO MANY FUCKING MEETINGS?!"
    new "冥界的所有職業中，魔王是最無聊的。自從老爸改革體系後，就只剩文書處理、開會、認證新折磨技術、開一堆會、公告說辦公室有新印刷機、開更多會、檢討每位惡魔的工作表現、開更多他媽關於下一場會議的會。啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊！哪來的這麼多會要開啊？！"
